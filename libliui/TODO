Am I actually using glut?
  This might be good because then I am able to use their functions to
   create frames, ..., as well as already having high quality code.
  In this case, do I want to write any sort of wrapper?
    If time permits, yes.

I need to have it set up so that there is a manager for the current
   app, that way I am able to set global properties.
  Propably do this whether or not I use glut.
    If I do use glut, combine this in my wrapper.

Maybe do everything percent wise in the beginning, then transfer over
   to layouts managing the percents.
  I think that this is the best way.

I need to go through and do a convention for variable naming.

NOTE:  things in core/ are to be used for performing actual
   simulations as well as in all 3d subprojects.  Therefore, I needed
   to create seperate utility classes for the interface library
   (because the interface is 2d).

I need to change everything to be in li::ui, since this is the UI
   library.

Check about moving corner points up to base class?
